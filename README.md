# ML_Classifiers
I have built some simple ML classifiers using the SKLearn library.

## Supervised Learning
I have trained a Logistic Regression model, K Nearest Neighbours classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, and a Support Vector Machine.

Change the value in the clf_opt variable to run different classifiers.
clf_opt = 'svm' for Support Vecotr Machine
clf_opt = 'knn' for K Neareat Neighbours
clf_opt = 'nb' for Naive Bayes classifier
clf_opt = 'lr' for Logistic Regression
